## 🧩 Project Overview

Welcome to my **sample QA portfolio**, featuring manual testing and defect reporting for two demo websites:

- 🗒 **To-Do List Website** — Simple task management app used for functional & UI validation.  
- ☕ **Coffee Cart Website** — Mini e-commerce cart tested for form validation, navigation, and purchase flow.
- 🛠️ **PARKING COST CALCULATOR Website** — Mini parking website tested for form validation.

These projects demonstrate **bug identification, defect documentation**, and **expected vs actual analysis** — all aligned with professional QA standards.
